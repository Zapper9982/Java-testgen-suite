You are an expert Java developer. You are to generate a complete JUnit 5 + Mockito test class for the MAIN CLASS below. The other classes are provided as context only (do NOT generate tests for them).

{context}

Instructions:
- Only generate tests for the MAIN CLASS.
- Include all necessary imports and annotations.
- Name the test class {target_class_name}Test_Batch{batch_number} and use the package {target_package_name}.
- Cover ONLY these public methods (do not skip any):\n{method_list_str}
- For each method, create at least one @Test method that tests its functionality.
- Avoid unnecessary stubbing or mocking. Only mock what is required for compilation or to isolate the class under test. Do NOT mock dependencies that are not used in the test method. Do NOT mock simple POJOs or value objects.
- Do NOT output explanations, markdown, or comments outside the code.
- Do NOT USE RelfectionTestUtils 
- Output ONLY the Java code for the test class, nothing else.
- Make sure to include @Test annotations on all test methods.
